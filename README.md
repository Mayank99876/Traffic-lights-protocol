# Traffic Lights Project

This repository contains the files for a traffic lights display project using Proteus 8.

## Project Files

- **project 6(traffic light protocol).pdsprj**: The Proteus 8 schematic file.
- **project 6(traffic-light-protocol).pdsprj**: The Proteus 8 project file.
- **sketch_sep21a_traffic_light_**: The source code for the traffic lights controller.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `project 6(traffic light protocol).pdsprj` file in Proteus 8.
3. Load the `sketch_sep21a_traffic_light_` file into your microcontroller. It's a hexfile. You can find the path by simply uploading in arduino and copy the hex file path from terminal.
4. Run the simulation to see the traffic lights in action.

## Description

This project simulates a traffic lights system with red, green, and yellow lights. The code controls the sequence of the lights to mimic a real traffic light operation.
